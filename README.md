# ToDo-Llist-App-in-React
 An application specially built to keep track of errands or tasks that need to be done
# Description of Project:
This is a simple ToDo list application built with React. The way this app works is simple. You input a task name or todo item into the input field (at the bottom) and hit Enter/Return to save it. You will see it appear as an entry above the input field. You can keep adding more items and have them all show up. To remove an item, just click on an existing item nd it will be removed.
# How to Run:
You can download all the files & folders to your local folder. Open terminal app and type http-server -c-1. Open your browser and type localhost:8080 to view the application.
# Roadmap of future improvements:
I plan to add more functionalities in the app.
